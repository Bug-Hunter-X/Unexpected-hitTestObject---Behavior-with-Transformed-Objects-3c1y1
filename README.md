This repository demonstrates a common issue with the `hitTestObject()` method in ActionScript 3.  When objects are scaled or rotated, their bounding boxes used for collision detection are affected, leading to inaccurate results. The `bug.as` file shows the problem.  The solution involves using a more robust collision detection method, such as pixel-perfect collision detection or a bounding box that compensates for transformations.
